Methods:
We created a driver diagram to describe all systems and variables that might influence ED wait times.  We obtained data on all patients admitted to the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia from June 30, 2016 to October 31, 2018, including hospital admissions, time of day, time of year, day of the week, admitting diagnosis, ED teams, and admitting teams.  We have conducted initial descriptive analysis and plan to use multivariable logistic regression to determine factors that significantly influence ED wait times.  Additionally, we will run these variables and outcome measures using machine learning random forest methods to see whether machine learning could be applied to determine the most significant variables that affect wait time.  Once these significant variables are determined, we will determine QI efforts based on the understanding of these variables and outcome relationships.

Results:  Preliminary results showed that 54% of all hospital admissions were admitted from the Emergency Department.  The average wait time from admission bed request to time of arrival on the floor is 142 minutes (median 115 minutes).  43% of ED admissions arrived to the floors between the hours of 8:00PM to 1:00AM, while 38% of non-ED admissions arrived to the floors between the hours of 2:00PM to 6:00PM.  The floors with the most admissions (5th and 9th floor) accounted for over 21% of ED admissions. Services with the most admissions were general pediatrics accounting for 37% of total ED admissions, surgical specialties at 15%, PICU at 8% of total admissions.  Data evaluation for machine learning methods.
